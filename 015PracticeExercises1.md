#E2-1

Write an AreaTester program that constructs a Rectangle object and then computes and prints its area. Use the getWidth and getHeight methods. Also print (printf) the expected answer.

#E2-5

Look into the API documentation of the Rectangle class and locate the method

```java
void add(int newx, int newy)
```
Read through the method documentation. Then **estimate** the result of the following statements:

```java
Rectangle box = new Rectangle(5, 10, 20, 30);
```

```java
box.add(0, 0);
```

**Without writing any code,**  type your **estimated** new X location, new Y location, new width, and new height. Your estimate can be inaccurate.

Write a program that will...

1. Print your estimated X location for the final box
2. Print your estimated Y location for the final box
3. Print your estimated width for the final box
4. Print your estimated height for the final box
5. Instantiate a rectangle at 5, 10 that is 20 wide and 30 tall
6. Add the point 0, 0 to the rectangle
7. Print the actual X location (using the getX method) of the final box
8. Print the actual Y location (using the getY method) of the final box
9. Print the actual width (using getWidth method) of the final box
10. Print the actual height (using getHeight method) of the final box

#E2-14

Look at the API of the Point class and find out how to construct a Point object. In a PointTester program, construct two points with coordinates (3, 4) and (–3, –4). Find the distance between them, using the distance method. Print the distance, as well as the expected value.
