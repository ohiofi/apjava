Cedar Point Trip

 

Mr. Cook has decided to send all student class officers from grades 6 - 12 to Cedar Point to thank them for their work. He doesn't know how many students will be attending, but has asked you to write a program that calculates and displays the total expense of the trip. He will need to send 1 teacher chaperone for every 4 students (rounded down). The trip could either be held in the fall (“summer admission price”) or held in the spring. They could either take school buses ($1300.42 per 44 person bus) or take charter buses ($1738.92 per 55 person bus). Mr. Cook hopes to be able to purchase transportation and admission, and give every person a $25 food allowance.
