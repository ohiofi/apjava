Use these String methods to recreate the sample output:

.length()
.charAt()
.substring()
.indexOf()
.replace()
Sample Output: This is a sample transcript of what your program should do. Items in asterisks are user input and should not be put on the screen by your program. Make your printf "field width" a large number (like 30 or more). The field width doesn't need to perfectly match mine.
```
Enter a long string: **The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog**
Enter a substring: **jumped**
Length of long string                                  44
Length of substring                                     6
Start position of substring                            20
Before substring was                  The quick brown fox
After substring was                     over the lazy dog
Enter a position between 0 and 43: **18**
Character at position 18                                x
Enter a replacement string: **leaped**
Your new string is The quick brown fox leaped over the lazy dog
```
Your program should work for any arbitrary string and substring. Here's another sample transcript of a different execution of the same code:
```
Enter a long string: **Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears**
Enter a substring: **try**
Length of long string                                  46
Length of substring                                     3
Start position of substring                            21
Before substring was                Friends, Romans, coun
After substring was                men, lend me your ears
Enter a position between 0 and 45: **21**
Character at position 21                                t
Enter a replacement string: **trywo**
Your new string is Friends, Romans, countrywomen, lend me your ears
```
