# P2-2

Write a GrowSquarePrinter program that constructs a Rectangle object square representing a square with top-left corner (100, 100) and side length 50, prints its location by calling System.out.println(square), applies the translate and grow methods, and calls System.out.println(square) again. The calls to translate and grow should modify the square so that it has twice the size and the same top-left corner as the original. If the squares were drawn, they would look like the figure below.

Your program will not produce a drawing. It will simply print the locations of square before and after calling the mutator methods.

Look up the description of the grow method in the API documentation.
